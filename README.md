# K-means
Here we will see unsupervised algorithm K-means.
It is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e data without defined categories or groups).
The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data( i.e Clusters), with the number of groups represented by the variable K.
The objective is to minimize the sum of distances between the data points and the cluster centroid, to identify the correct group each data point should belong to.

We will perform this on SNSdataset and Mall datasets.

# 1.SNS Dataset
 
Problem Statement ---- 

The many millions of teenage consumers using social networking sites have attracted the attention of marketers
struggling to find an edge in an increasingly competitive market. One way to gain this edge is to identify segments 
of teenagers who share similar tastes, so that clients can avoid targeting advertisements to teens with no interest in 
the product being sold.

Aim-- 

To Build K-means clustering model to classify the interest of teenagers by using various attributes.

# 2.Mall dataset

We have been tasked with identifying customer segments and delivering insight about our data in general, and about these clusters.
This is a real-world technique that can have a direct effect on how businesses behave towards their customers.
